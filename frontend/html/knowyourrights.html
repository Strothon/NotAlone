                Vice President of the Women and Democracy Association (KADEM) and daughter of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Sümeyye Erdoğan Bayraktar, in a newspaper interview, stated that the Istanbul Convention is an important tool and framework treaty for combating violence. She added that the termination of the treaty, especially being understood by implementers as the annulment of Law No. 6284, would have dangerous consequences. She also emphasized that public officials and NGOs should show special sensitivity to ensure there are no disruptions in the implementation of Law No. 6284. <a href="https://www.yenisafak.com/hayat/sumeyye-erdogan-yeni-safaka-konustu-genetik-kodlarimizda-kadina-saygi-var-3620213" class="highlight-link">Read the interview.</a>

Originally established as the Ministry of State for Women and Family in 2011, it transformed into the Ministry of Family and Social Services. In 2018, it merged with the Ministry of Labor and adopted the term "social services" instead of "social policy," and started working under the name Ministry of Family, Social Services, and Labor. Three years later, the two ministries were separated again. During this time, former minister Zehra Zümrüt Selçuk was replaced by Derya Yanık, a board member of KADEM, as the new Minister of Family and Social Services.

However, this claim is based only on data compared to the previous month, and since other variables were not taken into account, it is difficult to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the withdrawal from the convention and the decrease in femicides. Moreover, the data on domestic violence and femicides are not properly recorded, and the available data is not shared with the public in an organized manner.
